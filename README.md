# 🛒 Smart Micro-Inventory

A lightweight, mobile-first inventory management system designed for small shops.  
Most shopkeepers rely on registers or Excel sheets, which often leads to:

- 📉 Stockouts (customers leave disappointed).  
- 💰 Overstocking (money wasted on slow-moving items).  
- ⏳ Manual errors (time wasted in tallying).  

This project aims to provide a **simple and affordable solution**.
